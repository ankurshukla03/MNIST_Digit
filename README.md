# MNIST_Digit
- MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. 
- You can find dataset and more information about this [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer).

# Model1
- Predicted the Output using simple MLP(Multilayer perceptron) model. Used the 90-10% dataset for splitting into training and validation set. Check the code [here](https://github.com/ankurshukla03/MNIST_Digit/blob/master/Digit_MLP.ipynb). Got the accuracy of 98% from 95% when increased the number of epochs from 5 to 10.

# Model2
- Using a Convolutional Neural Network for increasing the accuracy from 98%. Check the notebook [file](https://github.com/ankurshukla03/MNIST_Digit/blob/master/Digit_CNN.ipynb) for more information.
